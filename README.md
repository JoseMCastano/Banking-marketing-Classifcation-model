# Banking-marketing-Classifcation-model
We analyze the data related with a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese bank, based on phone calls, from May 2008 to November 2010. The campaign objective was that the client subscribes a term deposit (deposit that a bank or a financial institution offers with a fixed rate, in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time). We initially performed an exploratory analysis of the data; we evaluate the incidence of the different variables in the target success and we analyze trends and behavior patterns of customers that will allow us to segment customers and provide recommendations to improve the results of future marketing campaigns. Finally, we create a classification model based on the Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the result of the campaign.
